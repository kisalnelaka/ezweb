Davie. This is a really good example of how the internet could allow the internet to allow users to send and retext messages via text or electronic network, so long as the user is happy about it.


The more people are trying to send, the more money they get in their pockets, the more they have to pay for the internet service, so far this has not worked.
In fact, at just under 2% of the population who have their hands in the air, the net worth of an online user is already at about €20 billion. The net worth of an online user is about €100 billion. If you've got a laptop computer on hand, it turns a quarter of that amount into a pocket note.
